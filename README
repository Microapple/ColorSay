Welcome to ColorSay!

This lightweight bucket plugin will help you customize your server to your liking.

INSTALLATION:
1) Drop the ColorSay.jar into your Craftbukkit server's plugin folder.
2) (Re)Start your server.
3) Edit the config.yml file to your liking.

COMMANDS:
/csay <message>

This is the one and only command ColorSay provides, but it is useful! Currently this command requires you to be an OP, but in future releases I'll add permissions support.
In the config.yml file, there are two items that you can configure: color and prefix.

Color changes the color of the CSay message. BE SURE TO USE ONLY THE COLORS LISTED IN THE CONFIG.YML FILE.
If you put 'orange' or some other random color in that spot, it will cause an internal server error. (Default is LIGHT_PURPLE)

Prefix changes who the message  should appear to come from. (Default is [Server] but you can change it to [GOD] or [ADMIN])
