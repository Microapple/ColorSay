Welcome to ColorSay!

This lightweight bucket plugin will help you customize your server to your liking.

INSTALLATION:
1) Drop the ColorSay.jar into your Craftbukkit server's plugin folder.
2) (Re)Start your server.
3) Edit the config.yml file to your liking.

COMMANDS:
/csay <message>

This is the one and only command ColorSay provides, but it is useful!
This command either requires you to have the permission node 'colorsay.csay' or be
and OP. (However, if permissions is installed, and you are an Op, you don't necessarily
have /csay)

In the config.yml file, there are two items that you can configure: color and prefix.

Color changes the color of the CSay message. BE SURE TO USE ONLY THE COLORS LISTED
IN THE CONFIG.YML FILE.
If you put 'orange' or some other random color in that spot, it will cause an internal
server error. (Default is LIGHT_PURPLE)

Prefix changes who the message  should appear to come from. (Default is [Server] but you
can change it to [GOD] or [ADMIN])

ChangeLog:

1.2.5
-Implemented Permission Support (permission node 'colorsay.csay')
-Works with or without Permissions installed. With Permissions, a player must have the
node to use /csay, without permissions, the player must be an OP.

-Console logging is now: ColorSay: PLAYER [PREFIX] MESSAGE
-Added code for Permissions support, hasn't been implemented yet
